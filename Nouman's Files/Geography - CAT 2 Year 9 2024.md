1a. Show the location of your allocated country on a world map. Remember to apply BOLTSS:

1b. Describe its location within the world and in relation to Australia:

Spain is located in southwestern Europe and is bordered by France, Andorra, Portugal and Morocco. In relation to Australia, Spain is located in the northern hemisphere whilst Australia is in the southern hemisphere, they are separated by more than two continents and vast distances.

2a. Australia’s GDP per capita is over $60,000 whilst Spain’s is somewhere between $30,000 and $40,000.

2b. Spain is in Stage 5 of the DTM. CBR is falling quickly and is unable to keep up with the number of the CDR. Australia is in Stage 4 of the DTM cause the CBR and CDR is low which is resulting in a stable population growth rate.

2c. Currently Spain and Australia are in the same HDI rank of 0.900 – 0.950 which is a pretty high rank.

3a. Spain had a more younger population ranging between 15-29 in 1994 compared to a more older population ranging between 45-59 years old in 2024. This could possibly be due to a baby boom around the late 1960s and early 1970s. This has been seen in the following graphs:











3b. Spain’s CBR in 2024 is 7.8 births per 1000 people. The CDR is 9.58 deaths per 1000 people. Spain has experienced a negative NI due to the death rate exceeding the birth rate.

3c. The religious ethnic composition of Spain is mainly Non-Practicing Catholics (35.2%) with Practicing Catholics and Atheists (both at 16.8% each) and other religions making up the rest of Spain. The infant mortality rate in 2021 was 2.6 deaths per 1000 births. The life expectancy for 2024 is 84.1 years.

Spain’s Infant Mortality Rate has declined by 0.6 since 2010 as it was at 3.2 deaths per 1000 live births. In 2021, this number decreased to 2.6 deaths per 1000 live births.



Spain has had a healthy increase in life expectancy. Their life expectancy was around 62 years old in 1950 but has had a steady increase to 84 years in 2024.
















Spain has a very high Non-Practicing Catholics presence with 35.2% of the population being Non-Practicing Catholics as of 2023. Practicing Catholics and Atheists share second place with a same percentage of 16.8%. Agnostic takes up 14.4% of the population with Indifferent/Non-believer’s taking up 12.9%. People who believe in a different religion or did not answer take up 2.4% and 1.6% completing the country’s religious ethnic composition.

4\. Has been addressed underneath the relevant diagrams

5\. Spain’s decline in IMR reflects improved healthcare and living standards, however maintaining these improved living standards require ongoing investments and addressing new and developing changes amongst the people. Spain’s high life expectancy is good as seen in the above diagrams, but an aging population poses challenges for pension systems and age-friendly infrastructure. Balancing healthcare costs with an older population is very important. 

6\. In response to the challenges posed by an aging population policies and legislations were introduced in Spain. One of the policies introduced was the “Law on the Autonomy and Care for Dependent Persons” on the 14<sup>th</sup> of December 2006, this law was made to establish a framework for active aging and the recognition of older peoples’ rights. The pension system in Spain has not seemed to have undergone any major changes since the late 1980s until the “reform” that was approved and legislated on the 1<sup>st</sup>  July 2011 in which, amongst other changes the retirement age was delayed to 67 and the introduction of the Sustainability Factor designed in 2013. The reason why these changes were made was the government recognized the need to adapt to demographic/economical changes, protecting the welfare of older people and to ensure the sustainability of public finances and social systems. Whilst data on public opinion is not exactly accessible, it is quite common that some of the population find such policies challenging/unacceptable if it involves changes to retirement age or pension benefits. 

7a. Spain’s aging population presents significant challenges and the government has implemented some policies such as the “Law on the Autonomy and Care for Dependent Persons” to address these issues. According to a report by “El Pais”, four Spanish provinces are projected to have the highest average age in Europe by 2050. This demographic trend is proof that these public health and safety policies are working but it also poses challenges for society. The MIPAA (Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing) report highlights Spain’s effort in recognising the potential of older people. However, the rapid aging of the population requires continuous adaptation of the policies, especially in areas like healthcare, pension reforms and workforce participation.

7b. Alternative approaches could potentially address Spain’s aging population more effectively. For instance, increasing support for families and children to boost the birth rate could offset the decline in workforce. Policies such as paid parental/maternity leave, affordable childcare and tax incentives for families with children could be helpful in having a more balanced population. These alternatives could help existing measures to create a more balanced approach to an aging population.
